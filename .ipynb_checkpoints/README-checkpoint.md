# Proactive and Reactive Infrastructure Investment Code

## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to provide most of the code I used in order to complete my job market paper, Proactive and Reactive Infrastructure Investment. I do not include any source files for data because these files are too large. Where possible, I include references to the source location of the files I have stored locally on my computer.

## Technicalities
I ran all of the code in this file using Python 3.8.6 in jupyter notebooks with jupyter lab.
